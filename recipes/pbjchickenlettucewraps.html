    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p> I know, upon first hearing PB & J Chicken, one might think, "WHAT?! Peanut Butter and JELLY on chicken?!". Have no fear, the "J" in this PB & J stands for "Jalapeno". That's right, this chicken is smothered in my peanut butter and jalapeno sauce. This recipe was an impromptu substitution that became a household favorite.</p><p> My original recipe was for an asian style peanut butter sauce with green and red peppers, but in a mental lapse, I forgot that my husband doesn't like green or red peppers! A problem indeed! Well, I substituted those peppers with jalapenos, my husband <i>LOVED</i> it and I coined this new fave, the PB & J Chicken Lettuce Wraps</p>
