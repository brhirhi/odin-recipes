    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>I love cheesecake as do most, and I remember the very first time I baked one. The trickiest and most inconvenient part was the bath. Trying to find the right size and depth of pan to achieve this apparently <em>crucial</em> step was more headache than it was worth (to me at least). I finsihed that cheescake in my newly bought springform pan, cleaned it, and banished it in my cupboard for years.</p><p>Fast forward about six years and I found myself promising a cheesecake for an engagement party, I was dreading it. I was haunted by the pressure and headache of the bath. So I started searching for a way to get around it. Thank God others felt my pain, for there were recipes that existed! This recipe that I found has been my go to since. The only tweaks were to the crust, as I prefer a thicker and higher one. I have done strawberry topping and even a pumpkin filling with this recipe, so feel free to add your own toppings or fillings to this base! I hope you enjoy this simpler recipe as much as I do!</p><p><strong>Note: It is <em>very</em> important that certain ingredients are ROOM TEMP, otherwise the consistency of the cheesecake will be all wrong!</strong></p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs (~2 sleeves worth)</li>
        <li>2 Tbs sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbs brown sugar</li>
        <li>10 Tbs butter (melted)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h3>Cheesecake</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>32 oz cream cheese (<strong>ROOM TEMP</strong>)</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sour cream (<strong>ROOM TEMP</strong>)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs (<strong>ROOM TEMP</strong>)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F</li>
        <li>Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Add melted butter and use a fork to combine well.</li>
        <li>Pour crumbs into 9" springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl (or stand mixer), add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy. Don't overbeat or you'll incorporate too much air (<em>consistency is key!</em>).</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Lightly beat the eggs seperately and gradually add them (~1 egg worth at a time), mixing until each egg is just incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into the prepared springform pan. Shimmy the pan a bit to even the mixture and allow any air to escape. Place on a baking sheet that's been lined with foil (to insure against leaks).</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F for 50-60 minutes (or longer as needed). Edges will likely be <em>slightly</em> puffed and may have just begun to turn a <em>light</em> golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but still be "Jello-jiggly".</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven (so it cools most gradually) for 10 minutes. Use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the springform pan on the edges (helps prevent cracks as the cheesecake cools and shrinks). <strong>Do not remove or loosen the springform pan!</strong></li>
        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temp before transferring to refrigerator. Cool overnight or for <em>at least</em> 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove from springform pan and <strong>ENJOY</strong>!</li>
    </ol>
